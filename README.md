## Project info
Migration & Integration of IDBS ELN with SoftMax
Streamlining Lab Workflows for Enhanced Efficiency and Compliance
Welcome to my project showcase. Here, I detail how our team successfully migrated IDBS Electronic Lab Notebook (ELN) to a web-based platform and integrated SoftMax for real-time data analysis. Discover how these improvements saved time, reduced errors, and increased overall user adoption.

## Project Details 
Project Overview
Objective
Our goal was to transition the on-premises IDBS ELN to a secure, web-based solution while integrating SoftMax for seamless, in-platform data analysis. This project required meticulous planning to ensure compliance with FDA regulations, improve user accessibility, and streamline lab workflows.

Scope & Approach
We began by defining clear objectives and success metrics, collaborating with stakeholders across IT, QA, and R&D. Using an iterative approach, we managed requirements in JIRA and maintained transparency through Confluence.

Key Challenges & Solutions
Regulatory Compliance
Challenge: Ensuring FDA 21 CFR Part 11 and GxP adherence.

Solution: Worked closely with QA to validate workflows, audit trails, and electronic signatures.

User Resistance
Challenge: Scientists reluctant to adopt a new system.

Solution: Offered live training, user guides, and a phased rollout to ease transition.

Complex Integration
Challenge: Linking SoftMax, IDBS ELN, and Tetra Science with minimal downtime.

Solution: Created clear data flow diagrams, ran iterative testing, and established open lines of communication with each vendor.
